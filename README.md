## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Web developer cruising through seven years of the "it works but I don't know why" and "it should work but doesn't" rollercoaster.
Somehow turned my obsession with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript into a career that pays actual money. I've had steamy affairs with React.js, midnight rendezvous with Next.js, and casual coffee dates with Vue.js when I'm feeling adventurous.
My toxic relationship with GSAP and Anime.js keeps me coming back for moreâ€”creating those irresistible animations that make clients swipe right. Deeply committed to Tailwind CSS (though we all know I've had scandalous weekend flings with Bootstrap that I don't post on social media).
WordPress and I have that classic love-hate relationship â€“ pure bliss when I'm crafting custom themes, absolute hell at 2 AM when I'm frantically Googling why that plugin decided to self-destruct. 

My ideal date?
Window shopping for new tech stack components while judging other developers' GitHub repos. When not smooth-talking APIs into giving me the responses I want, I'm usually at a coffee shop on a work date with my laptop, ghosting social invitations because "this bug won't fix itself."

My superpower?
Turning caffeine into code that makes clients say "wow" while my internal code comments scream "please don't touch this, it works but I don't know why." Will code for food, praise, or the rush of solving a problem that had me questioning my career choices for eight straight hours.
